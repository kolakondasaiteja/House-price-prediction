House price prediction employs various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to forecast property values based on features like location, size, amenities, and market trends. These models utilize historical sales data to learn patterns and relationships between predictors and prices, enabling accurate predictions for unseen properties. Feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model evaluation techniques play vital roles in enhancing prediction performance. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, stakeholders such as real estate agents, buyers, and sellers can make informed decisions, optimize investments, and navigate dynamic housing markets with greater confidence and efficiency.
